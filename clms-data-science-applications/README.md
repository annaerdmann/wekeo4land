# Data Science for Copernicus Applications 

## Overview

This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks developed to demonstrate the use of data science technologies in workflows with CLMS data.

The Notebooks were developed by the [European Topic Centre on Data Integration and  Digitalization](https://www.eionet.europa.eu/etcs/etc-di) (ETC/DI) consortium partner [Sinergise](https://www.sinergise.com/en/solutions/remote-sensing-and-machine-learning) in the context of service contract to support implementation of CLMS -2022/2023. 

## Folders

The folder `datacubes-snow-monitoring` includes notebooks showcasing fundamental concepts of working with datacubes, using the EuroDataCube platform. Even though the notebooks are specific for this platform, the concepts covered in the notebooks apply to work with datacubes in general. The notebooks show working with datacubes using Snow Data as an example.

The folder `ml-grassland-classification` covers a workflow using CLMS data to classify grassland. The main focus of the notebooks is the preparation of the data for the use in machine learning workflows.
